Classes information

properties or attributes --> what a class stores

methods --> how we mutate the properties or attributes stored


= new ClassName is an instance creating an object that can
be mutated by using instance methods

Employee john = new Employee("John");

john is a identifier that references the object
new Employee is a constructor method

static methods --> input all the data into the method
               --> it does not store any information
               -->The math class is a static class because none of the methods are instance method.
instance methods --> keeps track of information that the class is not aware of

variable --> holds information
instance --> value that the variable is referencing 

EXAMPLE:
Square is four equal sides --> instructions to make a square (Class)
a--> draw one square b-->second square
a and b are variable that identifes my instances (drawing) of a square
The class tells the computer how much space to save for our data
The constructor is what is building our squares for us and need to pass the value
that tells the computer how large to build our square
