/**
 * Author: Stephanie Scott
 *
 * Name: Program to calculate a monthly mortgage payment
 * assuming that the intrest rate is compounded monthly
 *
 * Date: 7/26/21
 *
 * calculate the monthly payment using the following formulas:
 * Monthly payment = (mIR * M) / (1 - (1 / (1 + mIR)^12*nOY));
 * where mIR = monthly interest rate = annual interest rate / 12
 * nOY= number of years
 * M = mortgage amount
 * 
 * output a summary of the mortgage problem as follows:
 * 
 * the total payment over the years, with only two significant digits after the decimal point
 * 
 * the overpayment, i.e., the difference between the total payment over the years and the mortgage amount, with only two significant digits after the decimal point
 * 
 * the overpayment as a percentage (in percent notation) of the mortgage amount
