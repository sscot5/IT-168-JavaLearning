 * Description: A program that to compute the commission for a salespersonâ€™s sales given the number of items sold and the total sales amount
 * 
 * If the sales amount is less than $5000, the salesperson receives a 5% commission
 * If the sales amount is at least $5000, the salesperson receives a 7.5% commission.
 * If the number of items sold was at least 5 and the amount of the sale minus the commission 
 *      is at least $20000, the salesperson receives bonus of $500.
 * All sales amounts are in whole dollars, though commissions are not.
 * The program is to print the total commission. If there was a bonus received, it also prints information about the bonus.
